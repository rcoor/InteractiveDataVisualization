                <br>
                <p><strong>Positive:</strong> this visualization has used a clever way of linking oscar nominated actors to
                    movies that has recieved an oscar. Linking multiple data points together can be relatively complex. The
                    author has put the actor in focus as big icons. It is clear that the actors are in focus. Having movies
                    as connected nodes makes it possible to have multiple actors connected to the same node and in turn figuring
                    out who have worked on the same movie.

                <p><strong>Negative:</strong> before understand excactly what was going on I had to read a few boxes of text.

                <br>
                <p><strong>Positive:</strong> a simple representation pie chart shows a division of different countries. There's
                    a power strong popup effect as it is easy to see which slice is bigger than the other. It works well
                    as the emphasis is on the size of emission.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Negative:</strong> there is an popout effect however this effect becomes smaller when you look at
                    the countries with least emissions. It's hard to see a difference between countries that have below 2%.
                    With the few amounts of countries representated it might have been better to show a simple bar chart,
                    which would have made it easier to spot differences even in countries with low CO2 emissions. </p>

                        <strong>Data: </strong> I have datafiles with 250.000 SNPs on 150 people. Some of these SNPs have
                        been linked to 20 categories which have a certain phenotype in fitness, nutrition and lifestyle.
                        Each category have a score that goes from 0 to 100. I would like to visualise, for each category
                        and all categories combined, a comparison between one persons unique cateogory result and the mean
                        of peoples result.

                        <strong>Story: </strong> I want the visualisation to tell a story about the unique individual. Where
                        are you compared to other people in this category and all categories combined. It should allow the
                        person to dive into his own genetics and explore him-/herself.
